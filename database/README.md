# Database

Migrations are generated using [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

## Installing migrate

```bash
  brew install golang-migrate
```

## Migrating

migrating for local databases

```bash
  make migration-local-up
```

downgrading for local databases

```base
  make migration-local-down
```

## Queries

If using `sqlc`, queries need to be manually created in `./queries`, and Go code for querying can be generated by running `make sqlc` command. The command will additionally generate a gomock file for `Querier` interface for unit tests

Files will be created in `/internal/db`. **DO NOT** manually modify the generated files, as they will be overwritten upon re-generation.
